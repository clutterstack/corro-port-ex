Data Collection & Aggregation:
  - AnalyticsAggregator - Collects and aggregates data across cluster nodes
  - Analytics modules - Store system metrics, message events, topology snapshots
  - Real-time data collection every 10 seconds during experiments

  Basic Visualization (HTML/CSS):
  - AnalyticsLive - LiveView dashboard with basic tables and stats
  - Simple metric cards showing node count, messages sent, acknowledgment rates
  - Basic tables for timing statistics and system metrics
  - No interactive charts or graphs currently

  Current Visualization Gaps

  Missing Interactive Charts:
  - No time-series charts for latency trends
  - No performance graphs or histograms
  - No network topology visualizations
  - No real-time updating charts

  Limited Analysis Views:
  - Tables only - no visual trend analysis
  - No comparative node performance views
  - No message flow visualizations

  Recommended Visualization Plan

  The codebase has excellent data foundations but needs charting libraries. A good plan would be:

  1. Add Chart.js or ApexCharts for interactive visualizations
  2. Time-series charts for latency/performance trends
  3. Network topology graphs for cluster visualization
  4. Real-time updating charts using LiveView's built-in reactivity
  5. Performance dashboards comparing node metrics

  The AnalyticsAggregator already provides comprehensive analysis data (timing distribution, node performance, message flow) that's perfect for visualization - it just needs frontend charting components.
